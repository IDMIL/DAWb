        The Digital Audio Workbench aims to provide an accessible interactive
        platform for intuitively exploring key concepts in digital audio.  
        Both Time- and Frequency-domain views of signals are presented, 
        as well as audio rendering of parameter manipulation.
        Numerous modular graphs are available, which can aid in
        teaching and studying issues such as aliasing, quantization,
        the effect of dithering, and more.

        Please follow the links below to explore different subsets of the
        implemented displays.  Note that so far we have only tested the
        project on recent Chromium-based browsers.  Furthermore, the display is
        not yet adequately responsive for mobile devices and other small screens.
